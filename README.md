# memo
More than a simple memo game.

Two game modes, free play and challenge. 

Unique points system. 

You can make your own game by creating a folder with pics in images folder. 

Only .png files a the moment. You should follow the convention as follow:

1. Create a folder with a name set{number}.{name}
2. Put 4 or 8 .png files with the names from 1 to 4 (8)
3. Put one .png file with the name of "front".
4. Check existing folders if you aren't sure.

And that's it.

To store your scores you should create two MySql databases with a name of memo and challenge, check initialize in start folder for sql syntax and database connection.
